    <p>Hi! My name is Cristian Taveras. You could also call me Tian. It's shorter and easier to call me in the wave of Cristians.<br>I like making pixel art and traditional art. I'm not very experienced when it comes to drawing digitally aside from sketching. <br> I like making pixel art because it reminds me of old games and I get a sense of how they used to make games under limitations. <br> This motivated me to start working on a game too. These are characters I've made so far.  </p>
