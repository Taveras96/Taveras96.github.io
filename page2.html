    <p>Hi! My name is Cristian Taveras. You could also call me Tian. It's shorter and easier to call me in the wave of Cristians.<br>I like making pixel art and traditional art. I'm not very experienced when it comes to drawing digitally aside from sketching. <br> I like making pixel art because it reminds me of old games and I get a sense of how they used to make games under limitations. <br> This motivated me to start working on a game too. These are characters I've made so far.  </p>

    <img src="images/map.gif">
    <p>This is a map I made. I'm using it for reference while working on my game. I have to make sure that the paths resemble what they look like on the map.<br>This took about 2 days to make, tweak, and polish. and I'm quite content with it. My friends also approved of it and many people online i showed it off to.</p>
